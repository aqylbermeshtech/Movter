# Movter

Movter is an iOS application that allows users to browse trending movies, view detailed information, and explore related content using The Movie Database (TMDb) API.

## Features

- Browse trending movies (daily)
- View detailed movie information
- Watch trailers (via YouTube integration)
- Display movie posters and images
- Smooth and responsive UI
- Networking with real API data
- Clean and scalable architecture

## Tech Stack

- Swift
- UIKit (programmatic UI)
- MVVM
- URLSession
- JSONDecoder (.convertFromSnakeCase)
- TMDb API

## Architecture

The app follows the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture:

- **Model** — represents API data
- **ViewModel** — handles business logic and data transformation
- **View** — displays UI and binds to ViewModel

This approach improves code readability, scalability, and testability.

## API Integration

Data is fetched from **TMDb API**:

- Trending movies endpoint:
- Movie videos (trailers):
Images are loaded using:

https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w185


## Main Screens

### Movie List Screen

Displays trending movies in a scrollable list.

### Movie Details Screen

Shows detailed information about a selected movie:
- Title
- Description
- Poster
- Trailer

## What I Learned

While building this project, I improved my skills in:

- Working with REST APIs
- Networking using URLSession
- Parsing JSON with JSONDecoder
- Using `.convertFromSnakeCase`
- Building scalable apps with MVVM
- Creating smooth UIKit interfaces programmatically
- Handling asynchronous data loading

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aqylbermeshtech/Movter.git
```

2. Add the two local-only files that are intentionally not committed:

   - **`Config/Secrets.xcconfig`** — create this file next to `Movter.xcodeproj` (i.e. a
     sibling of the `Movter` and `Movter.xcodeproj` folders, *not* inside either of
     them) by copying `Movter/Config/Secrets.xcconfig.example` and filling in your own
     [TMDb](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api) and
     [Guardian](https://open-platform.theguardian.com/access/) API keys.
   - **`GoogleService-Info.plist`** — download this from the
     [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) for the `movielistapp-13a53`
     project and place it in `Movter/`.

   > **What this does and doesn't protect.** Keeping `Secrets.xcconfig` out of git keeps
   > the keys out of the repository — it does not keep them out of the app. Xcode
   > substitutes both values into `Info.plist` at build time, so they are present in
   > cleartext in every build and readable from any copy of it. Use keys you are willing
   > to have public, and rotate any key that has ever been committed. The Firebase
   > `API_KEY` in `GoogleService-Info.plist` is a different case: it is a project
   > identifier rather than a credential and Google documents it as safe to ship —
   > access there is controlled by Firebase Security Rules, not by keeping the key
   > secret.

3. Open `Movter.xcodeproj` in Xcode and run.
